.Took a drive into the sprawl
.To find the house where we used to stay
.I couldn't read the number in the dark
.You said "let's save it for another day"
.I took a drive into the sprawl
.To find the places we used to play
.It was the loneliest day of my life
.You're talking at me, but I'm still far away
.Let's take a drive through the sprawl
.Through these towns they built to change
.And then you said "The emotions are dead"
.It's no wonder that you feel so strange
.Cops showing their lights
.On the reflectors of our bikes
.Said "Do you kids know what time it is?"
.Well, sir, it's the first time I felt like something's mine
.Like I have something to give
The last defender of the sprawl
Said "Well, where do you kids live?"
Well, sir, if you only knew what the answer's worth
Been searching every corner of the earth
.
